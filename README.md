# fmri_localizers
Some code for anyone interested in fMRI localization. <br>
I will continue to update with more scripts. 

## Currently included...
* Visual word form area (VWFA) and color localizers (Presentation)
* Spoken language and sound (music vs. environmental) localizer (Presentation)

### Presentation programming language

#### VWFA_Localizer_MRI.sce
* Dutch vs. Chinese words (ABAB)
* blocked design

#### VWFA_Color_Localizer_MRI.sce
* Dutch vs. Chinese words 
* Black vs. color 
* blocked design

#### Gustatory_Synesthesia_Localizer_MRI.sce
* Dutch vs. Foreign words spoken
* Musical instruments vs. daily environmental sounds
* blocked design

The VWFA, color and sound protocols were used successfully in the following publications. 
Note: The color localization used in these studies was similar but with letters instead of words.

* Colizoli, O., Murre, J. M., Scholte, H. S., van Es, D. M., Knapen, T., & Rouw, R. (2016). Visual cortex activity predicts subjective experience after reading books with colored letters. Neuropsychologia, 88, 15-27.
